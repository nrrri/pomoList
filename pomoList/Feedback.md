Great work Ferin!

I really think that the application is coming together really well.

A few points that I wanted to comment on:

1 - Great work on creating a separate file to generalize UI configurations like colors, padding, etc. That can be really useful in the future.

2 - I've left a few comments throughout the code about force casting, and force unwrapping, try to adapt these areas to avoid unintended crashes.

3 - I noticed that the timer itself is still not working properly, feel free to bring any discussion/questions about it during our next session. 

4 - I also mentioned a few improvements that you could try to implement regarding the reusability of the code, feel free to ignore these if you prefer.

Again, great work, looking forward to seeing the finished application.
